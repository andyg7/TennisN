# Tennis Notes App

## What is this?

This is the source code I wrote for an iOS app called TennisNotes. It lets you keep tennis related notes on opponents, yourself, and if you're
a coach, your students. All the data is stored in the cloud via Parse.com

## Environment

- Written in Swift
- Runs on iOS mobile systems
- Developed using XCode
- Uses Parse.com as the backend database

## Current status update:

This app is deprecated due to it's reliance on Parse.com, which essentially ceased to exist at the beginning on 2017. It was in
the app store from 2015 up until Parse.coms sad death.
